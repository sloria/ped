Quickly open Python modules in your text editor.

.. code-block:: bash

    $ ped django
    $ ped django.core.urlresolvers
    $ ped django.views.generic.TemplateView

    # Partial name matching
    $ ped django.http.resp
    Editing django.http.response...
    ...Done.

    # Specify which editor to use
    $ PED_EDITOR=vim ped django.shortcuts


``ped`` will find your modules in the currently-active virtual environment.


Get it now
**********

From PyPI:

::

    $ pip install ped


Or, run it with `pipx <https://github.com/pipxproject/pipx>`_:

::

    $ pipx run ped --help


Changing the default editor
***************************

``ped`` will try to use your favorite text editor. If you want to override the editor ``ped`` uses, set the ``PED_EDITOR`` environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

    # .zshrc or .bashrc
    # Use Sublime Text with ped
    export PED_EDITOR=subl


Opening directories
*******************

By default, ``ped`` will open ``__init__.py`` files when a package name is passed.
If you would rather open the package's directory, set the ``PED_OPEN_DIRECTORIES`` environment variable.

.. code-block:: bash

    # .zshrc or .bashrc
    # Open package directories instead of __init__.py
    export PED_OPEN_DIRECTORIES=1


Tab-completion
**************

The ped package contains tab-completion scripts for bash and zsh. Place these files in your system's completion directories. The ``ped.install_completion`` module can be run as a script to output the files to a given location. It determines the correct completion file from
the ``$SHELL`` environment variable.

Bash completion
---------------

To install bash completion, run::

    # The path given here will depend on your OS
    $ python -m ped.install_completion > /usr/local/etc/bash_completion.d

Zsh completion
---------------

To install zsh completion, run::

    # The path given here will depend on your OS
    $ python -m ped.install_completion > /usr/local/share/zsh/site-functions

This was inspired by `IPython's <https://ipython.org/>`_ ``%edit`` magic.
